Apache-Yaalr version 0.01
=========================

--==[ This is the README file for Yaalr - Yet Another Apache Log Reader ]==--

Yaalr reads an apache log and reports back on it with the following information:

	1. First date found in the log 
	2. Number of 'Hits' in the log
	3. Number of successful requests (i.e. 200 status code) 
	4. Number of 'Not Found' pages (i.e. 404 status code)
	5. Unique remote hosts found in the log
	6. Total number of bytes transfered, in Megs and Gigs
	7. Last date found in the log

Yaalr supports three types of log files:

	standard: This is the default apache log file, use the -s option to parse this type of file 
	combined: This type of log file has the referrer as well as other information combined into one
	          log, use the -c option if you have this type of log file
	combined with cookies: This type of log file is the same as the normal combined log file but it
		  also has a field for cookies, use the -f option for this log type

	(In the future, yaalr will go out and read your apache configuration file to determine which
	log file format you are using - then you won't have to specify on the command line.)

Options:
	-s 	Parses a common apache log file and produces a report on the command line.  
		Expects a file as an argument after the option.

       	-c      Parses a combined apache log file and produces a report on the command line.  
		Expects a file as an argument after the option.

       	-f      Parses a combined apache log file that includes cookies and produces a report on the command line. 
		Expects a file as an argument after the option.

Example:

	yaalr.pl -s /var/log/apache/access.log
